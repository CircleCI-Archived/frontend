This can be caused by one or more missing gradle build configuration files,
which some developers recommend including in `.gitignore` (i.e., so as
not to track them). If you meant for your checked in gradle wrapper
to be used by circleCI, make sure you also include:
* `build-gradle`
* `settings-gradle`
